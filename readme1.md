#In attendance command's script(attendance.bash), two functions(betweenDates and allAbsentees) outputs are complimentary to each other as the first one prints the absentees' usernames for each date between the two given dates while the other function prints the dates when each user was absent. Otherwise single function itself is enough.

#generalCommands script - For the first three commands (genuser,permit,schedule)
#headCommands script - For the last three commands (attendance,getmom,genom)
Two scripts because the last 3 commands should be aliased in Jay_Jay's .bashrc file for which the user must be created using the genUser command.
